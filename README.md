# Maps in Time

**Maps in Time** is an open-source web project that visualizes how territorial boundaries and administrative control change over time.

The project focuses on representing **historical states of the world map** using time-based data and documented sources.

---

## Overview

Maps in Time allows users to explore geographic territories across different points in time.

For a given day, the map displays:

* Territorial boundaries
* Which entities exercised control
* Which entities asserted claims
* Whether a territory is disputed during that period

All data is time-scoped and source-based.

---

## Scope

This project:

* Models territorial data as it existed at specific moments in time
* Supports overlapping and concurrent assertions
* Makes no assumptions beyond what is explicitly represented in the data

The map is a visualization of structured historical information.

---

## Disputed territories

Disputed territories are represented by:

* Multiple assertions applying to the same time range
* A dispute flag indicating overlapping or contested status

The project does not attempt to resolve disputes.
It represents the data as provided.
